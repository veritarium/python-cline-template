# Output Format (for transparency)

After each Act Mode step:
1) List exactly which files changed.
2) Summarize what changed in 3-6 bullets.
3) Propose exactly ONE command to run next (usually .\scripts\check.ps1).
4) If errors occur: quote only the relevant error section and propose the minimal fix.
